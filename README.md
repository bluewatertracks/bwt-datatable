# bwt-datatable

### News! New stable release 3.0.0
This package was updated to ES6 syntax and now support Polymer 3!

The new version `3.0.0` works only with Polymer 3.0 or above. If you want to use it with Polymer 2.* please use previous version `2.2.0`.

You can find new example how to use it in the file `example/your-datatable-implementation.js`.

### About
We greatly appreciated the work of [David Mulder's paper-datatable](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable) but since it hasn't been active for a while and we at Blue Water Tracks really wanted to keep pushing the work done so far, we decided to inherit the project and let it evolve but combining the pull requests on the project along with a couple of fixes and features that we came up with. Since many people already use the `paper-datatable` component, we created this component to make sure that it is compatible with the `paper-datatable` component. You can easily use this element only changing the path to `paper-datatable` import element like below. 
We hope that David takes what we have done with`bwt-datatable` and merges it into the original `paper-datatable`. 

### Before
	<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/paper-datatable/paper-datatable.html">

### Now
	<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/bwt-datatable/bwt-datatable.html">

If you already used selection toolbar in `paper-datatable-card` you need to add slot property to it like this: 

    <div slot="toolbar-select-single">
      <paper-icon-button icon="info" on-tap="info"></paper-icon-button>
    </div>
    <div slot="toolbar-select">
      <paper-icon-button icon="delete" on-tap="delete"></paper-icon-button>
    </div>

## New changes

 - Column header update dynamically according to [paper-datatable pull request #78](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable/pull/78)
 - Truly responsive; ability to use `bwt-datatable` on mobile devices by easily setting the  `responseWidth` property to the desired breakpoint resolution.

 		<paper-datatable data="{{data}}" selectable multi-selection response-width="767px">
			<paper-datatable-column header="Title" property="title" sortable editable>
			</paper-datatable-column>
		</paper-datatable>

</p>

- Table and/or column header can be fixed to the top of the page for better usability when you have very big amount of data in table. More info can be found [here](https://bluewatertracks.github.io/bwt-datatable/components/bwt-datatable/docs/docs.html?getting-started#fixed-header)

</p>

We also tried to add additional functionality and fix some of the bugs in paper-datatable and also merge the following pull requests for ``paper-datatable``
- Fix issue with null values inside paper-column [pull request #113](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable/pull/113)
- Change es6 to es5 code to support some of the older browsers [request #51](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable/pull/51) and [request #106](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable/pull/106)
 (Hopefully when Polymer 2 ships with transpiling, we can rewrite the code into proper ES6 code)
- Use textContent instead of innerHTML inside elements [request #108](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-datatable/pull/108)

## Installation

The element can be installed using bower using

    bower install --save bwt-datatable

**Important:** If you wish to use `<bwt-datatable-card>` you need the paper elements listed in `devDependencies` as well. They are not listed as normal dependencies to prevent them from being pulled in on production if you do not need them.

## Usage

Check out the [getting started guide](https://bluewatertracks.github.io/bwt-datatable/components/bwt-datatable/docs/docs.html?getting-started).
